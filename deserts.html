  <h1 class="heading1">The World's Deserts</h1>
  <div class="alignment">
    <p>Deserts are barren land which is a land that is the most hostile to live in for animal and plant life. Deserts cover 33% of the Earth's surface and are described as hot, dry and deadly. It only rains less than 25 centimeters (10 inches) each year.The largest Desert in the world is the Sahara Desert. Deserts can get really hot in the day but very cold at night. Life in deserts are so harsh that scientists study life there to help find clue about life on Mars.</p>

    <h2 class="heading3">What is Desertification?</h2>
    <p>Desertification is when fertile land turns into desert. It starts by land becoming dryer until it can't support plant life anymore so animals have to try and find a home somewhere else. Unlike species in the desert that can adapt to the harsh environment, species that live in fertile land start to die out.</p>

    <h2 class="heading3">What Causes Desertificaton?</h2>
    <p><b>Deforestation - </b>It is one of the leading human causes for desertification. Forests that are cut down without replanting them, plants and other vegetation that are gone leave no roots to keep the soil in place. There's no canopy that shields the ground from rainfall or the sun's blazing heat, the soil then dries out turns to dust.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Overgrazing - </b>When people round up animals in large herds in one area, grass and other small vegetation starts dying as the roots are weakened by constantly being stepped on by the animals and plucking new re-growing parts of grass before the plant has time to adapt. After sometime when there is no vegetaion is left, farmers move their livestock and repeats the process again.</p>

    <h2 class="heading3">Consequences</h2>
    <p>Desertifation leaves consequences for the land and people:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>Loss of biodiversity</li>
      <li>Forest fires</li>
      <li>Droughts</li>
      <li>Loss of crops</li>
      <li>Famines</li>
      <li>Shortage of drinking water</li>
      <li>Loss of fertile soil and vegetation cover</li>
      <li>Forest fires</li>
      <li>Destruction of habitats</li>
      <li>forced migration</li>
      <li>food production reduced</li>
      <li>Increased poverty</li>
      <li>Species become extinct</li>
      <li>Diseases spread and people become ill</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="alignment">
    <h2 class="heading3">Solutions</h2>
    <p>Here are some solutions that can help with preventing desertification:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>Planting more trees - the roots hold the soil together</li>
      <li>Improving the quality of the soil - encouare people not to overgraze animals adn grow crops instead</li>
      <li>Water management - water can be stored in earth dams (dams made of soil to create a circular hollow to store rain) in the wet season and used to irrigate crops during the dry season</li>
      <li>Magic stones - are circles made of stones place on the ground to hold water on the soil rather than letting it run over the surface</li>
    </ul>
